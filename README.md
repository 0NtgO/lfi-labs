# lfi-labs

small set of PHP scripts to test out LFI, RFI and CMD injection vulns

# why?

for training and testing purposes

the idea is that you'd add these to an Apache VirtualHost directive for testing purposes. if you need to do some quick and dirty testing, fire up `php -S 0.0.0.0:8080` or something and go to town.
